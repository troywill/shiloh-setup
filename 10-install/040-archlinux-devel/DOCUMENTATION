* How to use ABS?
  Building package using abs contain these steps:
  1. [ ] Install the abs package with pacman
  2. [ ] Running abs as root creates the ABS tree by synchronizing with the Arch Linux server
  3. [ ] Copy the build files (usually residing under /var/abs/<repo>/<pkgname>) to a build directory
  4. [ ] navigate to that directory, edit the PKGBUILD (if desired/necessary) and do makepkg.
  5. [ ] According to instructions in the PKGBUILD, makepkg will download the appropriate source tarball,
	 unpack it, patch if desired, compile according to CFLAGS specified in makepkg.conf, and finally
	 compress the built files into a package with the extension .pkg.tar.gz or .pkg.tar.xz.
  6. [ ] Installing is as easy as doing pacman -U <.pkg.tar.xz file>. Package removal is also handled by pacman.
