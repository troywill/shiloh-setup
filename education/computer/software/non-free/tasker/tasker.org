      I thought this might help some people.
      Waze has a very small API for launching the app and getting into navigation or search directly.  The direct code examples can be found on this page.

      In Tasker...
      Send Intent
      Action: android.intent.action.VIEW
      Data: waze://?ll=40.3560493,-105.4533494&navigate=yes
      Target: Activity

      This example uses latitude and longitude to take you to Hermit Park in Colorado. I used it for testing, since the only route there is via private roads due to the flooding here.  Waze, found it and warned me about the private road. Good thing, too.  I know those nut jobs, they are serious it is a private road.  I am sure they have lightened up though in the face of the floods.

      Other examples:
      Change the Data Parm to this in order to search for Denver Colorado
      waze://?q=Denver%20Colorado 

      The q= takes anything you could put in the search box in the app itself.
      The &navigate=yes is what tells Waze to begin navigating to that search or location immediately, but only if Waze can find a exact match for the search. For example...
      waze://?q=321%20Mountain%20Ave%20Berthoud%20CO&navigate=yes
      will take you directly to City Star Brewery in Berthoud Colorado but...
      waze://?q=Walmart&navigate=yes
      will present you with a list of the Walmarts near your location, and will not directly begin navigation.

      Hope this helps someone.
